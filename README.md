# OSD-scripts

Make sure the .s2s and .pls files for the OSD scripts reside in the Documents/Spike8/OSD folder.

These scripts will allow you to:

1) run an online sleep detection on 4 mice
  - OSD4 v1 1.04c.s2s
  - GH_OSD3.pls
  
2) run online sleep detection where the script delivers one of 5 different stimulations at random
  - OSD4 v1 1.04c_test script.s2s
  - GH_OSD3_random stims.pls
  
3) deliver a continuous stimulus longer than 10 seconds
  - OSD_J20.s2s
  - AV_OSDcont.pls
  
4) this is not an OSD script, it just allows you to set the start and end time and config file for a recording
  - anne_choose config.s2s
